# Pet-Adoption
Setup
Create a repository called pet-adoption and push up a README.md file
Create a setup branch and push up the usual stuff
Requirements
As a user, I want to see a listing of all available pets. Each pet should have a card that has all this data:
Image
Name: xxx
Color: xxx
Special Skill: xxx
Type of Pet: xxx
As a user, I want to see 3 category(type) buttons printed at the top of the page. Each should be a different color. These can be hard-coded.
I want to be able to click one of the 3 buttons, then only the cards that are in the category(type) should show.
There should be some way for the user to unfilter the results (ie All Pets button).
